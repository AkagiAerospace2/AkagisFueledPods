# AkagisFueledPods

Have you ever landed on the Mun, got back into Kerbin orbit, but just barely ran out of fuel before reentry?
Has your Grand Tour ship been unable to land its crew back on Kerbin because you ran out of fuel?
Does your space station lack effective escape vehicles for fear of part count issues?

Look no farther... with Akagi's Fueled Pods!

_a product of Faulcon Kerbspace_

## > Functionality

This mod adds a small amount of fuel to the command pods and lander cans - spaceplane functionality will come at a later point. The Mk1 Command Pod and Mk1 Lander Can are both optimized to fire a Spark engine for 7.5 seconds, and the Mk1-3 Command Pod and Mk2 Lander Can are optimized to fire a Terrier engine for 9 seconds.
